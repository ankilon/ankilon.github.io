description: Recently I have been obsessed over the new Nintendo game - Animal Crossing &#58; New Horizons (AC:NH) and have been playing it pretty much non-stop. Whilst this game brings a seemingly endless arsenal of great features, I have come to discover that it had a few usability drawbacks where I felt that some of the user interface could have been streamlined to be easier to use and less tedious. I decided embark on a personal project to see what some of these pain points were as a user myself and create some mockup designs to improve some of these features.  You can view some of my changes and redesigns by visiting my Behance post linked below!
